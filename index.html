		<p>My name is Eugene and I am on my great journey to become the best web developer in the North. Ok, just to
			keep it real, one of the best! I am anxious and grateful for any new programming challenges coming my way, I
			am ready to solve new problems but also make new mistakes, fixing them by the end of the day though. I have
			a lot of friends and family members working in the IT industry, in different areas and positions. I do want
			to expand my network meet more professionals alike learn from them and share some knowledge and experience.
		</p>
		<p>
			I am always looking for new and exciting projects, to learn and develop new skills. I did participate in
			developing and creating numerous websites almost 15 years ago, worked in the industry for a couple of years
			but had a big carrier change. I did work in managing positions in the construction industry for a long time.
			I learned almost everything I could in the new trade and finally decided to come back to do something I love and
			enjoy. The job that keeps my mind curious and my brain working. I am happy to see how the technology evolved
			in past 10 years. Becoming an excellent web developer is the most exciting and rewarding experience, I am anxious to
			learn and adopt new skills.
		</p>
		<p>
			I do hope I can get involved and new and challenging projects sooner than later. And I know that I can be a
			great addition to any project, I can work in a group or individually, I also can make an amazing coffee
			which is a skill I mastered for years. Iâ€™m the ideal candidate what are you waiting for?... Feel free to <a
